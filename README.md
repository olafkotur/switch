## üëãüèΩ About

_Switch started off as a very small project I created for myself to improve my workflow. Overtime I noticed other people enjoyed to use it too so I made some improvements to make it worthy and public. I would appreciate any feedback you may have on this project._

#### What does it do?

This is a simple lightweight browser and can be summoned over any existing application. It's designed to help you quickly interact with your favourite applications without losing focus.

My use case started with just wanting to check my [Notion](https://notion.so) notes during development. I then realised I use for so much more including `Discord` `Github` and `Twitter`. You can add most `webapps` of your choice to the Switch browser.
